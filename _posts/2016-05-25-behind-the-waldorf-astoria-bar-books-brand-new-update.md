  There are few cocktail guides with as much history as "The Old-Waldorf Astoria
  Bar Book" by Albert Stevens Crockett. The original source material, "Old
  Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but
  the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.
